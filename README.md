## ⚡ Overview

Food Delivery Client Site is a **frontend-only web application** built using **React.js**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **React Icons**, and plain JavaScript. The site offers a fast, responsive interface for browsing food items, viewing details, and managing a client-side cart. This project focuses on frontend UI/UX and does not include backend integration (data is handled via mock data or local state).

## 🎯 Key Features

* Modern, responsive, mobile-first UI built with React.js.
* Food item listing with images, names, prices, and ratings.
* Search and category filters to find menu items quickly.
* Client-side cart (add/remove items, view totals).
* Reusable UI components using Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.
* React Icons for visual elements and actions.
* Smooth interactions with JavaScript-powered state management.
